      Modern political science can generally be divided into the three
      subdisciplines of comparative politics, international relations, and
      political theory.[2] Other notable subdisciplines are public policy and
      administration, domestic politics and government (often studied within
      comparative politics), political economy, and political methodology.[3]
      Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields
      of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, human geography,
      journalism, political anthropology, psychology, and social policy.
      Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many
      methods originating in psychology, social research, and cognitive
      neuroscience. Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational
      choice theory, behaviouralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism,
      institutionalism, and pluralism. Political science, as one of the social
      sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquires
      sought: primary sources, such as historical documents and official
      records, secondary sources, such as scholarly journal articles, survey
      research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and
      model building. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses
